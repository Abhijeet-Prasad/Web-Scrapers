# Extract Tables From Website Using Pandas

## This is a Web Scraping project that I have built using Python that scrapes tables from websites and exports the data into an excel file.

### To build this scraper I have used the following python modules – 
-	![Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
-	![lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) [Must be installed in system]

I love watching anime. I am currently watching One Piece so to make this project more interesting I tried to extract One Piece episodes lists from Wikipedia page linked below.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_One_Piece_episodes

### Extracted Data
The extracted data contains the following information about the One Pieces Episodes – 
-	Season Number
-	Starting and ending episode number for each season
-	Season Name
-	Story Arcs
-	Number of episodes for each season
-	Aired Dates [First Aired and Last Aired Date]
-	Series Director Name
-	Series Composer Name
-	Character Designer Name
