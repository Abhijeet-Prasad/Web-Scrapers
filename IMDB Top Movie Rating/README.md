# IMDB Top Movies Rating

## This is a Web Scraping project that I have built using Python that scrapes Top Rated Movies from the IMDB website and exports the data into an excel file.

### To build this scraper I have used the following python modules – 
-	![Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
-	![BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/BeautifulSoup/)
-	![Openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/)

### What data is being extracted from the website??
The scraped data contains the following information about the movies having the highest IMDB rating – 
-	Rank of the movie
-	Name of the movie
-	Year on which the movie was released
-	IMDB rating of the movie
